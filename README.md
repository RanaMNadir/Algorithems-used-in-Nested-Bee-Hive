# Algorithems-used-in-Nested-Bee-Hive

Nested Bee Hive is an architecture of 6th generation of computer networks, which is achieved through multiple access points communicating with each other in 3D space. There for communication or path finding algorithms should be compatible with 3D space. We have intention to work on multiple simple and AI centric algorithms in future to find out best and 3D compatible communication or path finding algorithm. For now we have tested 3 algorithms “3D-Directional Treves”, “3D-Direction Greed” and “3D Dijkstra” on data with 125000 and randomly assigned cost. These algorithms are in initial phase a lot of room for improvement.


•	Install PYCharm or any other python ide.
•	Open the file of specific algorithm in ide.
•	Install all the dependencies / packages from interpreter settings.
•	Run the algorithm and results will be given in the form of CSV file.
